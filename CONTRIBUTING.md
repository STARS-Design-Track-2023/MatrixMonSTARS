# Guidelines for Contributing

Team members should...
- create a branch off the main repo for their work
- consistently commit their work with descriptive names
- push their work often to keep the repo up to date
- consult others before updating their work
- **only have one person work on any given file at a time**
- merge from the main branch before they are ready to upload new work
- **open a pull request on the main branch rather than pushing or merging**
- make a descriptive pull request and mention any relevant members or issues
- wait for their TA to test and approve their pull request

All guidelines are subject to change according to your TA

**TLDR: Read what's in bold**
